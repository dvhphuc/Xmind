Here are the project details:

- Xmind serves as the platform for creating mind maps, accessible at xmind.app.
- My task involves the creation of a software program that simulates the various elements within a mind map, including the Central Topic, SubTopics, and connections between these entities.
- My approach entails treating the mind map as a hierarchical Tree Data Structure, where each Node possesses multiple child Nodes. All operations performed on the mind map, such as adding, removing, or relocating topics, closely resemble operations carried out on a tree structure.
